Modified code from adafruit PyPortal 'count-up' program using the Pynt display to display the time in years-days-hours-min, and total hours, minutes since wedding anniversary

rename one of the above files to 'code.py' file in root of circuitpy drive

the original font was too thin, light so i created a new bitmap font based on CooperBlack font from my windows machine.   place "CooperBlack-28.pcf" file into "...root/fonts" directory
